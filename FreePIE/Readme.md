# FreePIE Scripts for Elite: Dangerous.

Requires [FreePIE](http://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/) to use, obviously.

### x52pro_mfd_freedom.py

Turns the Saitek X52-Pro MFD buttons into usable buttons within Elite. This clobbers several keys on the numpad,
(1-6, 7, and 9) so if you're already using those for something, this script may conflict with your setup.
